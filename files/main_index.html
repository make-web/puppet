        <p>this file is housed in the puppet-tilde module in
        /etc/puppet/modules/tilde/files/main_index.html. you will want
        to check out a branch in that module (which should be a git
        repo) and edit that file to reflect the individual beauty and
        loveliness of this, your one and own very special ~ server.</p>
